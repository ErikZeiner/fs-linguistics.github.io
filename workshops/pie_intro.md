## History of PIE
  

### Discovery of similarities with European languages.
- Europeans had been studying latin and ancient greek
- really complicated grammar (for English speakers at least)
- after they discovered sanskrit, they found certain similarities that they were able to connect them
- also later tied Germanic, Slavic into the mix
- Later discovered tocharian and hittite

### Grimm's law
- How they got Germanic involved

### Grimm's Law: Detailed Overview


In techenical terms, it is a chain shift voiced plosives -> voiced plain stops -> voiceless stops -> voicless fricative

 
  - **Voiceless Stops to Voiceless Fricatives**:
    - _Example 1_: PIE *p → Proto-Germanic *f

      Compare latin root pes vs English foot
       
    - _Example 2_: PIE *t → Proto-Germanic *θ (as in "th")
      Compare latin root tres vs english three
    - _Example 3_: PIE *k → Proto-Germanic *h
      Latin: centum vs english hundred

  - **Voiced Stops to Voiceless Stops**:
    - _Example 2_: PIE *d → Proto-Germanic *t
    latin: dens vs English tooth
    - _Example 3_: PIE *g → Proto-Germanic *k
   latin: genus vs English kin

  - **Aspirated Stops to Voiced Stops**:
    - _Example 1_: PIE *bʰ → Proto-Germanic *b
    latin: frater English brother

   Someone come up with more examples.
