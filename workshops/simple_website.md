# How to update the website


Today we are going to update the website becaues I'm sick of being the only one that updates it so I'm making you guys help me. 

I will try to make this as beginner friendly as possible. I also had the clever idea of having you guys help me modify this page as the first exercise, because I'm that lazy. 




## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- A computer

## Terminology

- **Website** this is what happens when you go to th efull website. Note that this is different from the repo, which is the *code* which will build the website
- **repo** where your code is, short for repository
- **fork** with git, everyone makes a copy, your own copy is called a fork, if you change your copy it won't cahnge the website, I have to merg eit in
- **file** this is the thing that you click on in a folder. Most of the files on the website is called markdown, and it ends in md.  
- **markdown** markdown is a special tyep of file that is very similar to regular plain text, but you have some special syntax for bold, itaclic and links.
- **Jekyll** normally, basic websites ar ebuild using technologies using html, css, and javascript. However, github offers this thing called Jekyll that allows you to write your website in mostly markdown. THat's why most of the *code* loooks like normal writing. 


# Updating our particular website

## How to do it the way you are not supposed to do it. 

Use thi smethod if you see that I can't spell correctly or have horrible grammar or I said something you don't like and yo uwant to remove it and you can't be bothered to learn git. 

### Find page you want to change on the git repo

This involves using the search on github and finding the file. 

### Click the edit file on the top right


### Do your changes

### Commit your changes and try to give a useful description of what you did

### click pull request

### wait for somone to merge it



## Using github desktop

This method is more educational for you because it wil teach you how to use the github workflow, while also providing a graphic interface if you are not ready for the command line. 

### Download github desktop 

### Use VS code or another text editor to edit the flie


### Use github desktop to commit

### Use github desktop to push

### Sbmit a pull request using the website 

### wait for someone to merge it in 

## How I do it

I use emacs, so I can edit the file, save, add, commit, and push by mashing random buttons on my keyboard. I do not recommend you learn emacs unless you have no life. 

# Updating your own website

Github offers every account a free corresponding static website. This will be yourusername.github.io

If you make your repo that name, it will automitaclly try to serve it to the website.

To start out, you can copy all of our file on our website and modify it. Or you can also follow github's guide.
