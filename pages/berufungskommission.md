[This page is a work in progress.]

When a new professor is hired at the institute, the hiring committee (Berufungskommission) includes not only university staff members, but also one or two students representing the Fachschaft.

How does the hiring process work?

They send an email and do stuff. 

What do the student representatives do?

How can they influence the outcome?
