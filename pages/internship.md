To get impressions of what the software internships can look like (and how different they all are) and to find out more about potential companies/organizations where you can apply, we recommend going to the **internship presentations**! They take place approximately twice a semester and are announced via email a week before they take place.

You should also check the [internship page on the SfS website](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/courses-of-study/courses-of-study-at-the-sfs/faq/is-an-internship-required/), which contains general information on the internship module as well as a sample list of companies where you could do your internship.
