## Some of the upcoming SfS classes are missing.

Don't worry! The SfS often takes its time when it comes to announcing all of its courses and course details on the university's online platforms. At the very latest, you'll get all the relevant course details during the GenLing/ISCL introductory GenLing/ISCL meeting at the very beginning of the semester.

## The semester is about to start and I can't sign up for SfS classes on Alma yet.

Don't worry! Generally speaking, it's not necessary to sign up for SfS classes before the semester starts. The lecturers announce if/how/when/where to sign up for the courses during the general introductory GenLing/ISCL meeting at the very beginning of the semester and/or during the first actual lecture.
