The Institutsbeiratssitzung (roughly institute advisory board meeting / IBR) is a regular meeting during which the professors of the SfS and some Fachschaft representatives (this time John, Paula, and Nicolai) meet to discuss allocation of funds (QSM) and general issues.

This semester's IBR meeting is scheduled for Monday, the 20th November from 11am to 12pm.
