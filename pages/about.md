The Fachschaft\* Sprachwissenschaft is an association of students, open to all who study at the [Seminar für Sprachwissenschaft (SfS)][sfs] at the [University of Tübingen][uni-tue], whether general or computational linguistics, or both. Our objectives are

- to help each other--especially new students--by sharing our experiences,
- to organize events for getting to know each other, and
- to lobby for improvements in the course of studies and at the university.

If you're interested in joining us, please come to one of the regulars' tables, write us an email/a message on Facebook or talk to one of us in person! We look forward to getting to know you :-)

\*Technically, the term *Fachschaft* refers to the entire SfS student body, but colloquially it is almost always used synonymously with *Fachschaftsrat* to refer to the group of student representatives. This is also how we generally use the term on this website.
