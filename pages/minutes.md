Our minutes live in [this repo](https://github.com/fs-linguistics/Fachschaft-Planning) and are done in Markdown.

The template we use for notes can be found there as well.

Generally, taking minutes is fairly easy (at least as far as the tech side is concerned). Take a look at either the template or some minutes to see how it's done.
