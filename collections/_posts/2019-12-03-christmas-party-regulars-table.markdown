Dear linguists and computational linguists,

We'd like to invite you to two events this month:  
 
First, we have a regulars' table this Friday (December 6th, 8 PM). It's at the Irish pub Saints & Scholars, just across the street from SfS. Everybody is welcome!

We'd also like to invite you to our annual SfS Christmas Party! It will take place on Thursday, December 19th (SfS room 0.02, 8 PM).  
As always, there will be free food, Glühwein, beer and nice music. A money box for donations can be found at the secretary's office on the first floor, any gesture is much appreciated! 
It would be also great if you bring cookies or some small snacks for the party :)  
We look forward to seeing you all there!
