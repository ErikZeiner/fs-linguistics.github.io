 'Tis the season to be jolly, and what better way to spread the holiday cheer than with a little CL/GL Christmas party? 🤩🎄

Dust off your ugliest Christmas sweater 🧥, grab your best bah humbug attitude 🤢, and join us for a night of festive fun and merriment on Friday, December 8th in VG 0.01, Wilhelmstraße 19. 🎅🎉

(Ugly sweater optional, however, please wear some sort of clothes, as it is not *that* kind of party)

So mark your calendars 🗓️, don your most questionable Christmas attire , and prepare to have a holly jolly good time! 🥂

Even if you're not a big fan of Christmas, we still want to see you there! Just bring your good vibes and get ready to have a holly jolly good time! 🥂🎄 We're all about spreading holiday cheer and enjoying each other's company, so no matter your beliefs, you're welcome to join us for a night of festive fun. Just remember to leave the Scrooge attitude at home! 😚(This is a threat to all the bad vibes!)
