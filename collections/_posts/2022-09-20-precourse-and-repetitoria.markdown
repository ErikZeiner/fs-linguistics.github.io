Hi there - old and new,

Here are two offers from students for students to make you ready for the winter term. :)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

# Pre-course
We are happy to announce that this year, for the first time, we're planning a **pre-course** for students who start their studies at the SfS. 

*What is it about?* - The main goal is to **facilitate the beginning of your studies**. Over the course of a week, we provide you with handy information about 
- general uni functionalities and self-organization,
- basics about programming, linguistics and necessary math, and
- how to set up your computer.

*When will it take place?* - 10-14 October, 2022 - so, just before the semster starts.

*What next?* - More detailed information about exact times and rooms, and how to register, will follow here. Stay tuned! :)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

# Repetitoria
Furthermore, we continue offering **repetitoria** for more advanced students.

*What are they about?* - **Revisiting the contents of previous semesters** covering topics such as programming (java and python), statistics, text technology, and linguistics.

*When will they take place?* - 10-14 and 17-21 October, 2022.

*What next?* - Same as with the precourse, more detailed information will follow, so please come back and check this site at a later point. :)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Wishing you all the best to settle into the mood of a new semster, 

â€“ The Fachschaft
