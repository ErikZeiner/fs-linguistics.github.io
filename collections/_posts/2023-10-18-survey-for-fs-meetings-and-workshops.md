2️⃣ Workshops: Casual, educational sessions aimed at fun and learning.

🎓 First Workshop Topic: "How to Update the Website"
🔮 Future Workshop Topics: Haskell, Prolog, Advanced Git, and more.

If you're potentially interested in participating in either or both types of meetings, please help us with scheduling by filling out the When2Meet link:
