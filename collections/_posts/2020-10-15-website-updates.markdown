Hey everybody,

We recently added some pages to this website:
- [Buddy programme 2020/21](/buddy-programme/) (Thank you to everybody who already sent us an email! And we look forward to hearing from more of you :-))
- [Using Alma Q&A](/alma/) (We plan to also add a guide to Alma to this page.)
- [Hiwi (student research/teaching assitant) Q&A](/hiwi/)

Please let us know if there are specific guides you'd like for us to add to the webpage or if you have (part of) a guide you'd like to contribute!
And if you’d like to share your thesis, your internship report/presentation and/or your Erasmus/exchange report to help out fellow students, please contact us!

All the best,

– The Fachschaft
