Hi all,

The next Fachschaft meeting is on Tuesday, November 2nd, at 8 PM.
We plan on discussing upcoming social events, current topics of the institute's advisory board, possible precourses for new students next year, and the possibility of getting English translations of the exam regulations.
You'll be able to find the link to the Zoom call on Moodle; please feel free to join us! :-)
