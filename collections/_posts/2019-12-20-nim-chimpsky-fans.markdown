Dear all,

Thanks for joining us at the Christmas party!  

Here are the results from the partygoers' donations:
- 43% for loving Nim Chimpsky and avoiding linguistics fights
- 32% for following Chomsky & generativism
- 25% for opposing Chomsky & generativism

<br>
A big thank you to all of you who donated a bit of their money and/or time to help us!


Happy holidays and enjoy the break! ‚ùÑ
