   Dear Ersties and Intro to GenLing-takers,

We hope this message finds you well.

We're writing to provide an update on the situation regarding the Intro to Gen Ling course. We understand that many of you are finding the course challenging, and we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

We've talked with the course instructor to discuss your concerns. We shared your feedback about the demanding nature of the material and the feeling of being overwhelmed. We also expressed your concerns about the fairness of the current workload and assessments.

The course instructor acknowledged your concerns and expressed a willingness to make adjustments to the course. However, he requested an in-person meeting to discuss the specifics of these adjustments. He is currently unwell and will be unable to meet until he has recovered.

We understand that this may be frustrating to hear, but we want to assure you that we are committed to working with him to find solutions that will make the course more manageable and equitable for all students, now and in the future.

To help ease your minds, we are also planning to offer a catch-up/make-up course to help students prepare for the upcoming mid-term exam on December 7th. This course will cover the key concepts and material that have been taught so far, and will provide an opportunity for students to ask questions and get additional support.

In the meantime, it would be nice if you start thinking about questions/problems and hardships you have so we don't have to probe you guys and make it all just a tad more efficient 

We believe in your ability to succeed and are here to support you every step of the way. Keep pushing forward!

Yours truly,
Fachschaft
