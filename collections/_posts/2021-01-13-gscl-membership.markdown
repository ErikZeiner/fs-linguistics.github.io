Dear all,

The [German Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL)](https://gscl.org/en) announced that as of the beginning of this year, [student membership](https://gscl.org/en/membership) is free. As a member, you can get to know other CL researchers, attend CL-related online talks and get cheaper admission to some German CL conferences. (Many of these events take place in English.)

Best,

The Fachschaft
