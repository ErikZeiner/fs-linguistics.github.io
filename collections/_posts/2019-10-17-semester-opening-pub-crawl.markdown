Dear all, welcome to our pub crawl!  
Here’s our schedule!
- 19.00–21.00 – **Neckarmüller**.
This is the only pub on our way which serves food! So jump on the opportunity, while you can!
- 21.00–23.30 – Our “secret” location.
The bar will be opened for us exclusively!
Beer and long drinks are waiting for you!
- Shot break! In Shooters (**Shooting Star**), with more than 100 shots to choose from!
- After that we will check out the **Clubhaus** party!
- (And if our previous experience taught us anything, afterwards we inevitably will end up in **Last Resort**)

Welcome to the new semester!

We're looking forward to getting to know you / seeing you again!
