Hi guys.

This is a reminder that we are in fact **NOT** dead. We had our first fachschaft meeting yesterday, and a quick reminder that Fachschaft meetings are currently at 7PM Fridays at the SFS building (Keplerstra√üe 2) in room 049. Feel free to join.  


# Reminder!!!

Do you think this website sucks? Do you think this website is dead, because nobody updated in 6 months? Do you think this website should be turned into an advertisement for your crypto pyramid scheme?

If you said yes to any of these things, guess what? This website is open source and on [github](https://github.com/fs-linguistics/fs-linguistics.github.io)! Feel free to make pull request with your own changes! If you need help, instructions should be in the sidebar. I (John) would appreciate any help, since it's been mostly me updating the website for the past semester. And I now resort to passive agressive messages to beg for help.
