Dear Students, Professors, Colleagues and Fans of the SFS,

The Fachschaft Sprachwissenschaft wants to invite you to the annual
Christmas Party!  
It takes place on Wednesday, December 19th, at 8pm in the
Verfügungsgebäude room 0.01.  
Everybody is invited and there will be free beer, Glühwein, and
nonalcoholic beverages for you.  
You are also invited to bring your favorite christmas cookies made by
you, your grandma or a supermarket of your choice. We set up a donation box in the secretary office so feel free to be a little Weihnachtswichtel!

So save the date, we look forward to meeting you!:)

Hohoho,  
The Fachschaft Presidents
