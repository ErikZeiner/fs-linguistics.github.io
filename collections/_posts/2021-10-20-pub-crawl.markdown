Hi all,

We have to move the pub crawl to a new date, likely sometime next week.
We'll update you about the exact date/time and the locations as soon as possible!

The virtual Ersticafé on Friday will still take place as planned.
Thank you to everyone who came to the regulars' table on Monday---it was very nice to meet you all :-)

See you again soon!

– The Fachschaft
