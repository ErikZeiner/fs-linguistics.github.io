# Public Presentations by Candidates for replacing Prof Hinrichs

Hey all,

Thursday, the 16th of October and Friday, the 17th of October, the short-listed candidates to replace Prof Hinrichs will hold short presentations followed by questions from students. 

The first presentation will be held at 9:00 AM in room 110 in Keplerstraße 2.

If you're interested in seeing who we invited and in shaping the future of the department or just love (computational) linguistics, do show up!

There will be three presentations on Thursday and three on Friday. 

The first presentation on Friday will start at 9:00 AM in room 110 in Keplerstraße 2.

Sorry for the late update,

Nicolai/Fachschaft
