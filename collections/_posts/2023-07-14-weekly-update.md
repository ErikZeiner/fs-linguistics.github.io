Hello everyone.

Today nobody came to our meeting ðŸ˜µ . 

But I will still update our website to show that we are not dead. 

If you would like to see the Fachschaft do more stuff, please come to our meetings.

If you want the Fachschaft to die, pls ignore. 

Anyway, we don't have any events planned because it's really hot outside and I don't want to do anything.

We are planning sometime in the future to become a twitch streamer and make it big. Our first stream will be about changing our name to be more inclusive or something.
That's about it, hopefully more people will come next week.
