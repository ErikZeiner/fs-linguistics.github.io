Happy new year!

We just concluded our first Fachschaft meeting of the year. 
Our main talking point consisted of the results of the beginning-of-the-semester questionnaire, which we will share with the SfS's advisory board tomorrow and on here soon as well :-) Thank you again to everyone who participated in the questionnaire!

Tomorrow, the first **office hour** of the semester will take place at 4 PM via Zoom (link on Moodle).
