# Public Presentations by Candidates for replacing Prof Meurer

Hey all,

Next Thursday, the 17th of October and Friday, the 18th of October, the short-listed candidates to replace Prof Hinrichs will hold short presentations followed by questions from students. 

The presentations will begin at 9:00 AM on Thursday and at 8:30 AM on Friday.

The presentations will be held in room 110 in Keplerstra√üe 2.

There will be three presentations on Thursday and three on Friday. 

If you're interested in seeing who we invited and in shaping the future of the department or just love (computational) linguistics, do show up!

Hoping to see you there,

Nicolai / The Fachschaft
