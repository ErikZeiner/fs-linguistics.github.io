üîî Calling all seasoned students! üîî

Do you remember the excitement and challenges of your first semester? The command line confusion, the hunt for the right place to live, or finding the best study strategies? Now you have the chance to turn those experiences into invaluable guidance for the next wave of students - and get paid for it!

We're hosting a one-week event from October 9th to October 14th to offer support and insight to first-semester students. We're looking for people to share their wisdom on a range of topics. The subjects we're covering include:

Technical skills:
- Installing and using an IDE
- Navigating the command line
- Basic debugging strategies

Life skills:
- Finding the right place to live
- Evaluating whether the program is a good fit
- Identifying effective study strategies

Beyond presenting your chosen topic, you'll serve as a friendly point of contact throughout the week, ready to answer spontaneous questions and provide real-time advice. 

And yes, this is a paid opportunity! Just make sure to sign up in within two weeks so we can sort out your contract without a hitch.
