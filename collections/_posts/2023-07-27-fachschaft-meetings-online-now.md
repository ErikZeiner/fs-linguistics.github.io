Hello everybody, from now to accomate those who may not be physically present, Fachschaft meetings will now be online. 

They will be held in our new discord server. 

https://discord.gg/jKmhSWJ3mh

I made this because the old invite link for our other server rotted away, and I need to figure out who is in charge of our old one to fix it. 

Additionally, as a measure to increase our efficiency, we will now be using an agenda. To keep things on topic, any discussion that we do must be first entered into the agenda before the meeting starts. This means now is the time enter what you would like to discuss.

Hope to see you online at 5PM tomorrow.
