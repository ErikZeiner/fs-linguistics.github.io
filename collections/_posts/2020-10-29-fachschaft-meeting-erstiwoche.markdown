Hey everyone,

We had a meeting today to plan the start of the winter semester. 
This is just the short summary; the long version is in our Telegram group (let us know if you'd like to join!).

1. **Erstiwoche**, the welcome week for new students (all events will take place online!):
- Monday, Nov 2, 6:15 PM. Regulars' table / open Fachschaft meeting: get to know us and find out how the Fachschaft works and what we do!
- Tuesday, Nov 3, 4 PM. Ersticafé (we help you with any questions about studying or living in Tübingen) and speed-friending (get to know your future classmates).
- Thursday, Nov 5, 8 PM. Virtual pub crawl. Bring a few drinks and your favourite snack!
2. **Intro meetings.** We will briefly introduce the Fachschaft during the SfS intro meetings for all students of General and Computational Linguistics on Monday.
3. **Buddy programme.** We decided who will match up pairs/groups of people. You can still sign up until November 4th!
4. **Moodle.** We're currently setting up our Moodle page. This is where we'll share links to the online events. It will be accessible to all students starting next week!
5. **Office hours.** We will have online office hours where you can ask us questions every week or every other week. The first office hour will be on Tuesday, Nov 10, 5 PM.
6. **Discord.** We set up a Discord server for SfS students (link on the aforementioned Moodle page).
7. **In-person activities.** Definitely not possible at the moment. Once the Covid-19 situation improves, we might be able to plan some hikes or other activities.


All the best and see you soon,

– The Fachschaft
