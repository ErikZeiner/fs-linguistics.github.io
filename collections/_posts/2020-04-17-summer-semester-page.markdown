Hey everyone,

We added a page where we collect information on semester opening meetings and classes offered at the SfS (and by the computer science department): [fs-linguistics.github.io/courses-sose2020/](/courses-sose2020/).  
It contains some additional information to our previous post and will be updated in case we find out more.
