We're still in the process of updating this Fachschaft webpage so you all have up-to-date information about the general/computational linguistics study programmes here, and now we need your help!  
We want to fill the pages on
- [BA and MA theses](/thesis/)
- [Software internships](/internship/)
- [Studying abroad](/abroad/)

<br>

If you'd like to share your thesis, your internship report/presentation and/or your Erasmus/exchange report, please contact us!
