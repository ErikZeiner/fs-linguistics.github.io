Hello, we have some game night changes.

First, we are changing the game night to game night and/or group study to encourage more people to come, because some people have homework. You can play games the whole time, study the whole time, or take a break from studying and play a game. 

Second, we have a room change. It is now it **Brechtbau 035**. (The building across the bridge from the SFS building)

Reminder, it's at 7PM tonight!
