Hello everyone, to show that we are not dead, we have decided to start a weekly summary to recap what was discussed in the Fachschaft meeting. 


First we got an advertisement in our emails.

[bright](https://www.brightnetwork.de/uber-uns/) is offering an online workshop on June 30th about getting internships. If anyone cares, we can send you the email. 

# Change in Fachschaft meetings

We have decided to change our meeting times to Fridays at 5:00 PM! 

# Events next week!

Even though next week is Pentecost (Pfingsten), we will still have events next week. This is for students that have boring lives and gives them a chance to finally touch grass.

## Game Night!

On Wednesday, May 31st, we will have a game night/picnic. It will be at 7PM in the BOTA (Old Botanical garden). Please bring your own games. Also it would be nice if some of you could bring snacks. And someone bring tarps too. 

## All purpose tutorial!

The all purpose tutorial will be next week on Friday on June 2 at 3:00 PM  to 5:00 PM in the Fachschaft room. You can ask any questions that you may have or just study there with your peers. 

## Next Fachschaft meeting! 

The next meeting will be at 5:00 PM in the Fachschaft room right after our all purpose tutorial.
