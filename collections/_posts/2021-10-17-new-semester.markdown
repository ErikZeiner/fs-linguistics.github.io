Welcome (back) to Tübingen!!

We're looking forward to meeting all you new students and to seeing the "old" students again :-)

To get this started, we've planned a welcome week, starting tomorrow(!!):

- Monday, October 18, 8 PM -- ??. **Regulars' table** at Saints & Scholars (Wilhelmstr. 44), right across the street from SfS. All new & old students at the SfS are welcome! Note that the pub has a 2G covid regulation, meaning you need to show some proof that you've been vaccinated or that you have recovered from covid.
- [Edit: Date moved!]. **Pub crawl**. Get to know some of Tübingen's night life! We'll share the locations soon, but all of them will be either 2G (vaccinated/recovered) or 3G (vaccinated/recovered/tested).
- Friday, October 22, 2 PM -- 4 PM. **Ersti helpdesk**, via Zoom (we'll share a link on the Fachschaft Moodle page). Are you a new student and have questions about your studies / need help with picking classes / are confused about life in Tübingen/Germany? We'll help you :) If you're not able to attend the helpdesk, don't feel shy about asking questions in the *#ask-the-fachschaft* channel on Discord or sending us an email!

The link to the Discord server and the link to the Zoom meeting are / will be shared on our Moodle page: [https://moodle.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de/course/view.php?id=1181](https://moodle.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de/course/view.php?id=1181)

See you soon!
