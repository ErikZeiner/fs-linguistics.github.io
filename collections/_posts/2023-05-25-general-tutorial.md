Hello everyone, it seems like some of you guys would be interested in a general purpose tutorial.

The format will be casual, so I don't have anything planned, but this format may change depending on feedback.


It will be tomorrow in the Fachschaft room (SFS room 049) at 4:00PM and go until 7PM.  You can then join us for our weekly fachschaft meeting.
