# History of Chinese Characters

Chinese characters, also known as Hanzi (Chinese), Kanji (Japanese), Hanja (Korean), and Chữ Hán (Vietnamese), have a rich history. Originally used for writing Classical Chinese, they have been adapted for other languages across Asia, much like Latin in Europe. However, in most countries, they have been largely replaced, and local languages are now written in other scripts or use English.

## Evolution of Chinese Characters

Chinese characters have evolved significantly over time. Below are some key stages in their development:

1. **Oracle Bone Script (甲骨文)**: The earliest form of Chinese writing, used during the late Shang Dynasty.

2. **Bronze Script (篆書)**: Used during the Zhou Dynasty, featuring characters inscribed on bronze objects.

3. **Regular Script (楷書)**: The modern standard form of Chinese characters.

## How Chinese Characters Work

Chinese characters are logographs, where each character represents a morpheme in the language. They can be categorized as follows:

### Semantographs

- **Pictograms**: Characters derived from images. Examples: 日 ('Sun'), 月 ('moon'), and 木 ('tree').

- **Ideograms**: Characters representing abstract concepts. Examples: 上 ('up') and 下 ('down').

- **Compound Ideographs**: Characters formed by combining elements to convey meaning. Examples: 明 ('bright'), 休 ('rest'), 好 ('good').

### Phonetics

Many characters are phono-semantic compounds, combining a phonetic element with a semantic radical. For instance, characters like 河, 湖, 流, 沖, and 滑 all include the water radical (氵) and convey meanings related to water.

## Sino-Xenic Pronunciations

The influence of Chinese characters extends to other East Asian languages. Here's how the same character can have different pronunciations:

| 一 | ʔjit  | yī  | yāt  | nhất | il   | iti  | itu  | i   | one   |
|----|-------|-----|------|------|------|------|------|-----|-------|
| 二 | nyijH | èr  | yih  | nhị  | zi   | ni   | zi   |     | two   |
| 三 | sam   | sān | sāam | tam  | sam  | san  | san  | san | three |
| 四 | sijH  | sì  | sei  | tứ   | so   | si   | si   |     | four  |
| 五 | nguX  | wǔ  | ńgh  | ngũ  | wo   | go   | go   | u   | five  |
| 六 | ljuwk | liù | luhk | lục  | lyuk | roku | riku |     | six   |
| 七 | tshit | qī  | chāt | thất | chil | siti | situ |     | seven |
| 八 | pæt   | bā  | baat | bát  | phal | fati | fatu |     | eight |
| 九 | kjuwX | jiǔ | gau  | cửu  | kwu  | ku   | kiu  |     | nine  |
| 十 | dzyip | shí | sahp | thập | sip  | zifu | sifu |     | ten   |


### Mandarin Sound Changes

- **Deletion of Final Consonants**: [p], [t], [k] -> ∅ / _#
- **Deletion of Initial Ng**: [ng] -> ∅ / #_
- **Merge of Final m and n**: [m] -> n / _#
- **Palatal n to Rhotic**: [nyV] -> er (V = any rime)
- **Palatalization Before Front Vowels**:
  - [k] -> [tɕ] / _[+Front]
  - [ts] -> [tɕ] / _[+Front]
  - [h] -> [ɕ] / _[+Front]
  - [s] -> [ɕ] / _[+Front]
  
  
### Korean Sound Changes

- **Deletion of Initial n, ng**: [n], [ng] -> ∅ / #_
- **Final t to l**: [t] -> [l] / _#

### Japanese Sound Changes

- **Epenthesis to Final Consonants**: C -> Cu / _# (where C is a stop)
- **Denasalization of ng Word Initially**: ng -> g / #_ 
- **Merge of Final m and n**: [m] -> n / _#
