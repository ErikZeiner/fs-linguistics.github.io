Hi all,

We are going to meet on Zoom tomorrow (**March 9th**) at **7 PM**. We plan to discuss the current state of the study programme and the instructions for the next Lehrbericht (teaching report) of the institute, as well as feedback concerning individual classes and social activities for SfS students. Feel free to join us if you have thoughts regarding these (or any other relevant) topics! The link to the meeting will be on Moodle.

We hope you are all doing well and can enjoy the spring break!
