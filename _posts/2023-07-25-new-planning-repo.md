Hello everyone, have you even wanted to be involved in Fachschaft, but didn't know what it was?
Or maybe you thought about joining, but you thought they were useless and they didn't do anything. 
Or maybe you thought the meeting was too boring because nothing got done? 

To address these issues, we've decided to open a Github Repo to help with planning events. It is public, so anyone can contribute without even coming to our meetings. It will also help with transparency, so everybody knows what is going on, and what the current event is. 


The link is [here](https://github.com/fs-linguistics/fs-linguistics.github.io).
