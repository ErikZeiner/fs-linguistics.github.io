Hi all,

Two conferences for students of general and computational linguistics (*Studentische Tagung Sprachwissenschaft* and *Tagung der Computerlinguistik-Studierenden*) will jointly be held online in April. If you want to present the findings of your BA thesis or of a term paper or seminar project that you put a lot of work into, or if you want to meet linguistics students from other universities and find out what kind of research they are working on, this might be the place to do that!

- Registration deadline (7 €) and talk submission deadline: April 19, 2021
- Conference dates: May 6 – May 9, 2021
- Website: [https://69.stuts.de/](https://69.stuts.de/)

Best (and good luck if you submit a talk proposal!),

– The Fachschaft
