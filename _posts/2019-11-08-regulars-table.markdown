Next Monday the 11th of November, there will be the next Stammtisch for all (computational) linguists! Stop by if you want to hang out with your fellow students, have some beer and food and chat a little bit. Everybody's welcome!

We will meet at 6 PM at the Irish pub Saints & Scolars, you just need to cross the street coming from SfS :) 

We're looking forward to seeing you there!
