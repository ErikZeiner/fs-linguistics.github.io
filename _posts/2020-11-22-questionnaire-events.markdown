Hi all,

We created a **survey** to get a better impression of how you experienced the beginning of the semester. You can find it on [our Moodle page](https://moodle.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de/course/view.php?id=1181). Every SfS student is very welcome to participate; we're looking forward to getting your impressions and feedback! Filling out the questionnaire shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

We also planned the next two social events: 
First, an online **game night** on Friday (November 27), starting at 7 PM.
The week after, we're gonna have another virtual **pub crawl**, by popular request: on December 04, starting at 8 PM.

See you soon!

â€“ The Fachschaft
