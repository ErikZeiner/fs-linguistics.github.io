Dear general & computational linguists,

Good luck with the upcoming exams and final projects!  

Once the exam phase is over, we want to celebrate with you! Join us for the last regulars' table before the beginning of the lecture-free period ðŸŽ‰  
It will take place at NeckarmÃ¼ller on Friday, February 7, at 8 PM. 

We're looking forward to seeing you there!
