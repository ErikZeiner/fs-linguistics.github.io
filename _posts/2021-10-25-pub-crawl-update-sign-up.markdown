Hi all,

If you'd like to join the pub crawl on Friday, please fill out [**this sign-up form**](https://forms.gle/Sd541AfC8PWSjZ1Z9) so we can get a better idea of how many people will join us :-)

The bars in Tübingen all have 2G (*geimpft* ("vaccinated"), *genesen* ("recovered")) or 3G (*geimpft*, *genesen*, *getestet* ("tested")) rules, meaning you need to show a certificate proving that one of those "G"s applies to you.
(The same goes for cafés, restaurants, museums, gyms, etc. etc.)
If you haven't been vaccinated yet, the university offers vaccinations for all students/employees (more info [here](https://uni-tuebingen.de/universitaet/infos-zum-coronavirus/impfen/)) and the [TüNewsInternational website](https://tunewsinternational.com/sub-impfnews-category/) also provides information in German, English, Arabic and Farsi (you need to scroll down a bit to get to the articles in the different languages) on how to get vaccinated in Tübingen.
(Obviously, you won't be fully vaccinated in time for the pub crawl, but you'll be able to enjoy the benefits of the vaccine protection in about 1-2 months :-))

See you soon!

– The Fachschaft
