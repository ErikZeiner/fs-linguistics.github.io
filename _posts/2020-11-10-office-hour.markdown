Hi all,

We had to move the Fachschaft office today to **4 PM - 5 PM** (instead of 5 PM - 6 PM). The Zoom link is already on our Moodle page. 
If you stop by during this office hour (and the upcoming ones in the next weeks/months), we'll try to help you with any questions or issues you have regarding studying computational/general linguistics in Tübingen.

– The Fachschaft
