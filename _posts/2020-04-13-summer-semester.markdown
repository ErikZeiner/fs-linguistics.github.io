Hey everyone,

We hope you are all doing well. 

We don't know much more than you do about what the upcoming semester will look like.
What we know is that it will take place, starting next week with online classes, since a lot of people cannot come to Tübingen or even Germany for the foreseeable future.  
Make sure to regularly check Alma, Moodle and Ilias to get the most up-to-date information on the classes you're interested in taking.
The university and the SfS have some more information on how this semester will take place:

- **Semester opening meeting** (ISCL): Starting on 2PM of April 14th, you can join this Moodle version of the introductory meeting: [https://moodle.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de/enrol/index.php?id=836](https://moodle.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de/enrol/index.php?id=836)
- **Course list** (General Linguistics): The course list for the summer semester can be accessed via the red box on the lower right-hand side of

- While there are no in-person office hours right now, you can still contact your study advisors and other SfS staff via email.

We hope you had a nice holiday and are staying safe!
